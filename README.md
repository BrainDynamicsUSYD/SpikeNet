## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Autoconf (a tandard tool on OSX and linux distributions)
* A c++ compiler that supports c++11 standard (GCC 4.2.1 or later; Intel C++ 12.0 or later).
* HDF5 c/c++ API (open source)
* Matlab (2013a or later) is optional but highly recommended.
* Portable Batch System (PBS) is optional but highly recommended.

#### FAQ
Q: What if I am using Windows?
A: Sorry you are on your own. 

Q: What if I do not have or hate Matlab?
A: You can either request I/O interface in Python from us or contribute to the project by translating the existing Matlab I/O interface into Python or other langangues.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
